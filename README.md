This project implements a Smart Street Light System designed to optimize energy consumption through automated and intelligent control of streetlights. Leveraging IoT technologies, the system adjusts lighting based on environmental conditions and provides real-time monitoring of lamp status through a web-based user interface powered by Node-RED.
