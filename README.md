Overview
This project implements a Smart Street Light System designed to optimize energy consumption through automated and intelligent control of streetlights. The system adjusts lighting based on environmental conditions and provides real-time monitoring of lamp status through a web-based user interface powered by Node-RED.

System Architecture
The system consists of two main boxes, each equipped with sensors and an ESP32 controller. These nodes work together to control the brightness of streetlights and monitor their operational status. Data from the sensors is sent via MQTT to a Node-RED dashboard, allowing users to monitor and control the system remotely.
